# Terms of Service

This service is made available free of charge. We're just a bunch of developers
who very much want to use our skills to help people obtain vaccines.

The data that we use comes from vaccinespotter.org and we are very grateful for 
their making this data available. 

No guarantees are made or implied about the accuracy of the data. We are simply making
our best good faith effort to help people become aware of when appointments are available.

Keep in mind that between the time that you receive the notification and visit
the provider's website, someone else could have already claimed that appointment.
